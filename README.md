# Name Transcriptor
**Name transcriptor** is a tool for proper name orthographic transcription from various languages into Russian. It turns proper name spelling from Latin script to Cyrillic script using standard spelling system of respective language.

**Name transcriptor** is a project in process. As for now it presents only the back-end logics for name transcription. Basic GUI will be introduced at a later point. At this time app supports only a number of languages but new ones are added on a weekly basis.

## Features

Since service is primarily intended to transcribe proper names (like personal or geographical names) it implies words are provided in either of three conventional character cases: lower case, Title case and ALLCAPS. Words in MiXeD case are automatically cast to Title case. 

Automatic transcription by its very nature can not offer flawless result at all times but aims to be as close to it as possible. 

Any feedback is kindly welcome.
